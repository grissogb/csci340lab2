    <h1>Dogs vs Cats</h1>
    <h3>
      <p>It's very simple. You can see here are two images, of a dog and a cat, as well as two buttons, labeled as such. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to choose which of the animals in the image is better.</p>
      <p>What "better" means is, of course, up to you. It could mean cuter, it could mean more likely to win in a fight, it could be who's gonna win a basketball competition (although the dogs have the advantage there, I'd say).</p>
      <p>When you've made your decision, click the loser's button, and it will change to a new one of the same animal, and in the bar next to this button you will see the number increase, as this animal's "winning streak" as it were.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this site is for you to have fun, and see some pictures of cute animals.</p>
